Come to OMH 119 to learn how to use the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, made popular through services like [GitHub](https://github.com).

We'll be talking about how to make new repositories, commit changes, create branches, and other useful `git` commands.

We use Git for all of our projects, so a basic understanding of how to use it is necessary for working on any of our projects. Because of this, we'll also talk about a few things particular to GitHub, where our repositories are hosted.
