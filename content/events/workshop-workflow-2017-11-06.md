Learn how to use the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, made popular through services like [GitHub](https://github.com), and the [Trello](https://trello.com) board system that we'll use for keeping track of project tasks.

For Git, Michael will be talking about how to make new repositories, commit changes, create branches, and perform other common operations, as well as a few GitHub-specific items. Tyler will then give an overview of Trello's interface and how to use it in the context of our project this year.
