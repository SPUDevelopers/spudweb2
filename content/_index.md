# Welcome!

You've come across the SPU Developers website, where we will post announcements for the club and other information about events and programming resources!

SPU Developers is a club meant to bring community to the Computer Science and Computer Engineering departments of [Seattle Pacific University](https://spu.edu/). We host events throughout the year and travel to different companies like Microsoft and Google to get familiar with local companies - small or large.

This year we will be working on building a game that will be featured in the Erickson Conference at the end of May! The club has weekly meetings from 5-6 PM on a to-be-announced day of the week where we hang out and have snacks. Subscribe to the calendar in the sidebar for updates on when meetings will be. Anyone is welcome to join in on the projects that we work on throughout the year, but we're just as happy to have you stop by and chat. Regardless of your programming experience or inexperience, come in and hang out!

To communicate we use Slack, a instant messaging app based on IRC used widely by companies for communication. To join, go to https://spudevelopers.slack.com and sign up with your SPU email! We try to keep all the classes updated there so that everyone can talk about homework and share resources.

Thanks for visiting and we look forward to seeing you all this year!
