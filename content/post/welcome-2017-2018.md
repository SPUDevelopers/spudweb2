Here in the SPU Developers club, our goal is to foster community among the Computer Science and Engineering students at Seattle Pacific University, as well as to help our fellow students prepare to join the workforce of software developers. We do this a number of ways, including club projects, workshops, business tours, LAN parties, and our annual hackathon.

Come see us at one of our weekly meetings, or go to our [officers]({{< ref "officers.md" >}}) page to read a little bit about each of us.

# Club Events

Throughout the year, we'll have a number of events that anyone can attend. We recommend subscribing to the [#events channel](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C2H6Y99EG) in our Slack for updates. You can also subscribe to our calendar using the handy "Subscribe" button in this website's sidebar.

- **Apple devices:** Clicking/tapping the button should be enough to subscribe.
- **Google Calendar:** Follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100). The URL you want is `webcal://spudevelopers.club/index.ics` - the `webcal://` is important, as it tells Google to subscribe to any changes to the file.
- **Outlook.com:** Follow [this guide](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-Outlook-com-or-Outlook-on-the-web-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c), specifically the section for subscribing to (not importing) a calendar. Use the URL `webcal://spudevelopers.club/index.ics`.
- **Android:** (w/out Google Calendar): Install ICSDroid ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.icsdroid) $1.49) ([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.icsdroid/) $0) and tap the "Subscribe" button. ICSDroid should open with the URL already entered.

## General and Interview Prep Meetings

This year, we'll meet twice weekly: once for a general club meeting and once for an interview preparation workshop. Meetings are **Mondays from 5:00-6:00pm in OMH 245** and **Wednesdays from 5:00-6:00pm in OMH 119**. To maximize people's opportunities to come to meetings, the general meeting and interview workshop will swap days each week. This means that one week will have the general meeting on Monday and interview prep on Wednesday, then the next week will have interview prep on Monday and the general meeting on Wednesday. If you're confused, you can also follow the above instructions and get reminders on when each meeting will be.

## Business Tours

In the past, SPUD members have been able to tour companies like Microsoft, Google, and Valve.

{{< figure src="/images/tours/google-2017-01-18.jpg" caption="SPUD visited Google last January." >}}

We plan to continue the tradition of doing the tours this year, so subscribe to our events channel on Slack to stay informed with tours and other club events.

## Workshops

Over the course of the year, various members of SPUD will be able to host workshops to teach some topic relating to software development. This will often be lead by one of the officers and relate to the development of a club project, but other members are welcome to contact an officer about hosting their own workshop. The best option is to send a message in the [#workshops channel](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C7AT2J8AJ) on Slack, but email and face-to-face work too.

We prefer that people leading a workshop also provide a written tutorial to be posted on this site. The tutorial can then be viewed by people who could not make it to the workshop, as well as anyone wanting to review the material at a later point.

## Did you say... hackathon?

Yes! Each year, SPUD organizes a campus-wide hackathon that anyone can enter. There'll be judges, prizes, food, and anything else needed to have a good time (computer not included).

If you don't know what a hackathon is, it is a competitive programming session where people work on a project in groups for a set period of time - usually 24 to 48 hours - and the projects are judged at the end of the session. The top projects - coolest idea, best implementation, however the judges define it - then receive prizes.

Hackathons are a great opportunity to work on that project idea you've had bouncing around your head for a while and see what other people have thought of.

# Club Resources

The two main resources that SPUD currently uses, aside from this website, are [GitHub](https://github.com/SPUDevelopers) and [Slack](https://spudevelopers.slack.com).

If you plan on contributing to any SPUD projects, you will want to [sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have an account. More instructions on how to contribute to SPUD projects on GitHub will come in the future, around the same time as the related workshop.

We use Slack as the primary form of instant communication within the club, with various channels for information relating to events, workshops, and more, as well as general chat and channels for the various computer science classes at SPU. The intent behind the latter channels are to be able to ask for help with homework in the various classes.

You can sign up for a Slack account using your `@spu.edu` email address [here](https://spudevelopers.slack.com/signup/). We recommend joining the [`#general`](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C26JFFXPW), [`#events`](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C2H6Y99EG), and [`#workshops`](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C7AT2J8AJ) channels, plus the [`#interview`](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C7J4TEWHM) channel if you want to prepare for coding interviews.

Prefer connecting using an IRC or XMPP/Jabber client? We have both enabled on our Slack instance - [see the docs](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP) for how to connect using these protocols.

# What's This Club Project? (And Do I Have To Work On It?)

We're still fleshing out the details of the project for this year, but you can expect to see a blog post when it's ready. And no, SPUD members are not required to work on the project, though it's a great chance to see what it's like to work with a group on code intended for *actual* use.

We'll be here to give you a hand in learning any new technologies for the project, though you *do not* need any programming experience to help out. Non-programming tasks we'll need help on include testing and writing documentation - not particularly glamorous tasks, but necessary for a *good* project.

# Questions?

If you have any questions about the club or what we do, leave a comment below or get in touch with us in [`#general`](slack://channel?team=T26H3LSHZ&id=C26JFFXPW) on Slack.
